## freeCodeCamp Guide Articles
This repo is where we plan and maintain freeCodeCamp's guide articles, which we then host on our community's wiki-like [guides website](guide.netlify.com/docs).

### What are Guide Articles?
<!-- I would like to link to existing articles from here when they are available -->
Guide articles can be an explaination of a syntax, design pattern, what aria labels are for or something like what the numbers mean in the top right hand corner of your screen when at freecodecamp.org.

### What can I write an article for?
- Take a look through our issues and find an article request that you can write up.
- Find a `stub article` on our [guides website](guide.netlify.com/docs) and write the article to remove the stub.
- Open an issue with an article request, or indeed an article you have written.

### How to contribute
- We are open to you just using the GitHub interface to suggest edits or suggest a brand new article.
- If you prefer to write locally and submit a PR then please use fork the repo and `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/guide-articles.git`

We're happy to help answer any questions you may have and give you feedback on your articles. :sparkles:
