### How can I contribute?
1. Find a topic you can help with

2. Propose a script as a [markdown file](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) in a Pull Request
  - Create a new branch with `<yourusername-videoname>`
  - Create a new file labeled `<video-title.md>` within the appropriate folder (`scripts/<unit-title>/<video-title.md>`). If that folder doesn't exist yet, create one!
  - Save your changes and open a pull request comparing to master. `@` mention brianamarie for feedback.
3. Record your video
  - Set up a whiteboard and read the things
4. Comment in your PR with the link to your video. `@` QuincyLarson and brianamarie
  - You'll get feedback, and we'll work with you to help refine the video so we can include it on FreeCodeCamp.com
