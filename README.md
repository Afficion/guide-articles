## freeCodeCamp Video Challenges
This repo is where we plan freeCodeCamp's video challenges, which we then post to our community's popular [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/freecodecamp).

### What are Video Challenges?
Video challenges are 2-minute-long videos that teach high-level concepts relevant to software development. 

We assume:
- Viewers will watch these mostly by stumbling upon them in YouTube search. Thus they should be modular and make sense out of order.
- Viewers will watch these on a mobile phone while commuting, so you should write text and draw diagrams as large as possible on the whiteboard.
- Viewers will not take time to complete follow up tasks, like running code or reading additional articles. Assume the video is the only contact they will get with the content.

### Current Video Challenges
