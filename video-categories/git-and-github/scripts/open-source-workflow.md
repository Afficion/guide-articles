## Open Source Workflow on GitHub

#### Fork & Pull Workflow
- What is forking?
  - Forking is creating a copy of an existing repository under your own user or organization account. 
- Why do we fork? 
  - Forking is usually the best way to collaborate when you don't have permission to make changes to an existing repository.
- How do we do it?
  - Create a fork
  - Make changes on your own fork 
    - This can be done locally, but it is recommended to use the branching workflow within your own repository
  - Open a pull request
    - Base fork: original; Base branch: (master)? (dev)?; Compare fork: your own; Compare branch: your own
    - Be sure to `@` the people who work on the original project so they will see your changes
    - Discuss the changes you have implemented and ask for feedback 
- Note: Keeping forks updated can be tricky if you are not working locally. Keep local clones of forks updated by setting multiple remotes.    
- Forking a repository is a common way to collaborate to open source projects.
