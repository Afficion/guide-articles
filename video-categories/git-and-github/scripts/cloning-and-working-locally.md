## Cloning Repositories and Working Locally

#### Working Locally
- What does it mean to "work locally"?
  - Git is a distributed version control system, meaning you can work on projects on your own computer without internet or other network connectivity
  - Much of the awesome functionality of git is accessible on GitHub, but for a lot of it, you need to bring a copy of the repository (project) to your computer by cloning it
- Cloning repositories
  - Cloning a repository means you have an exact copy of the upstream, or original, repository
  - The original repository is called the 'remote' repository
  - This includes all of the branches and all of the committed history
  - You can pull down changes that have been made on the remote, and push up changes that you have made locally
  - Many people can clone the same remote repository to collaborate on the project together
- Why would you work locally?
  - If you are only editing small documents, it's OK to use the remote on GitHub.com
  - If you are wanting to use your own IDE or text editor, you will need to clone locally
  - Locally, you can fix things like merge conflicts and use many of the cool functionalities that Git offers
