Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with discrete (finite) sets of elements rather than continuous sets. Imagine trying to run a program that requires an infinite number of executions to complete a task. It is obvious to say that the program would run forever, and the task would never be completed. In order to avoid this problem we approximate continuous sets with discrete sets.

Now you may be thinking, “I never use math that involves infinite sets” but I promise that you do. The simplest example is a circle. By definition, a circle is an infinite set of points equidistant from a fixed point. What is the significance of this? Well, imagine trying to draw the circumference of a circle with a computer program. Unfortunately, this is impossible. And I mean it, this isn’t just theoretically impossible, it is physically impossible! 

Because we have to draw an infinite amount of points, our points would have to be infinitesimally small. So right away, we have failed our task. We would need to plot points that are smaller than electrons!

Now everyone has seen circles on computers, so how are they produced? The answer is that they aren't true circles, but they are good enough. That is, what you are witnessing are approximations to circles.
For example, consider a regular pentagon. This doesn’t look like a circle. How about a hexagon? This still doesn’t look like a circle. How about an octagon? Dodecagon? Hexadecagon? Icosagon?

You can see that these regular polygons are beginning to take the shape of a circle. Which should be unsurprising, as the vertices of the polygons are all equidistant from a fixed point, like a circle. Eventually, the difference between these regular polygons and a circle will become indistinguishable to the naked eye, which is precisely what we wanted to achieve.
