This video is all about logic. I want to start with an excerpt from “Book of Proof” by Richard Hammock who gives an excellent definition of logic. “Logic is a systematic way of thinking that allows us to deduce new information from old information and to parse the meanings of sentences.”

Based on this definition it is unsurprising that logic is quite possibly the most important concept in mathematics! I agree, that is a bold statement, but without logic it would be impossible to write proofs. Why is this significant? Without proofs, the foundation of mathematics would collapse, and we would be doing nothing more than making guesses with numbers!

Why should all programmers be well-versed in logic? Developers and software engineers should be well-versed in algorithms. What is the foundation of algorithms? You guessed it, mathematics! What is the foundation of mathematics? Logic.

o begin our understanding of logic, I will introduce the notion of a proposition. A proposition, also known as a statement, is a declarative sentence or mathematical expression that is either true or false. This is perfect for computing, since computers operate on a binary number system. These propositions are commonly denoted by the letters p or q.

For example, the statements p≣“Rain falls from the sky.” and q≣“Ghana is a country in Asia.” are declarative sentences with a verifiable truth value. In this case p is true and q is false. In contrast, statements such as, “What are you doing?” and “Wash the laundry.” are not declarative sentences. We call these open sentences, because they do not have a verifiable truth valuable.

In addition to propositions, there are also composite propositions. In fact, many propositions are composite. These composite propositions are composed of subpropositions and logical operators, but we will discuss these in the next video. Also, if a proposition cannot be further decomposed, it is called primitive proposition. You have already seen two primitive propositions, p and q.

Join me in the next video where I will elaborate on composite propositions, logical operators, negations, and truth tables.
