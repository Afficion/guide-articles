This video is all about logic, which is also know as propositional calculus. I want to start with an excerpt from “Book of Proof” by Richard Hammock who gives an excellent definition of logic.

“Logic is a systematic way of thinking that allows us to deduce new information from old information and to parse the meanings of sentences.”  - Richard Hammock’s, “Book of Proof”

Based on this definition it is unsurprising that logic is quite possibly the most important concept in mathematics! I agree, that is a bold statement, however without logic and deduction, proving anything in the world of mathematics would be impossible. Mathematicians use logic to construct proofs. Programmers use logic to develop algorithms.

To begin to use logic, you must first understand what a proposition or statement is. A proposition is a declarative sentence or mathematical expression that is either true or false. These propositions are commonly denoted by the letters p or q. This makes sense, as computers operate on a binary number system, which you can learn more about in the “Computer Basics” section on FreeCodeCamp.com.

For example, the statements p≣“Ice floats in water.” and q≣“Ghana is a country in Asia.” are declarative sentences with a verifiable truth value. In this case p is true and q is false. Furthermore, statements such as, “What are you doing?” and “Wash the laundry.” are not declarative sentences. We call these open sentences, because they do not have a verifiable truth valuable.

You can also have composite propositions. In fact, many propositions are composite. These composite propositions are composed of subpropositions and logical operators that we will discuss in the next video. Also, if a proposition or subproposition cannot be further decomposed, they are called primitive propositions. You have already seen two primitive propositions, p and q.

Join me in the next video where I will elaborate on composite propositions, logical operators, negations, and truth tables.
