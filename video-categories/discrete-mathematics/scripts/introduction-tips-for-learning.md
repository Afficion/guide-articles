Hello world! My name is Shawn Grooms, and this is the first video for the discrete mathematics series. Here are my three tips for learning with video challenges.

#1 Stay Calm
People often hear the word mathematics and stop listening! They panic or just assume they aren’t going to understand what is being taught. This isn’t true! Just relax. You aren’t being graded on the subject, so why are you stressing out? :)

#2 Rewind
Remember that you can rewind the videos! Trust me, when I was sitting in my mathematics courses I wish I could have rewound. Fortunately, you can rewind at anytime, so you have an incredible advantage for learning the material! I strongly encourage rewinding the videos!!!

#3 Explain
Once you think you understand the material in the video, I challenge you to teach someone else the material. You can choose to explain this to a friend, other students on FreeCodeCamp, or simply try to explain the material to yourself out loud. Programmers will sometimes conduct “rubber duck debugging” where they explain their code to a rubber duck line by line until they figure out what isn’t working. I encourage you to try this method in mathematics and programming, as you quickly find gaps in your understanding and bugs in your code.

Enjoy!
