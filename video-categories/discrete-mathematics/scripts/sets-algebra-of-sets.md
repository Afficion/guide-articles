Both this video, and the next, rely heavily on the material from my video on set-builder notation and common sets. We are going to cover quite a bit.
So, if you aren’t comfortable with the last video, please review it before continuing! In this video we are going to cover the eight laws of the algebra of sets.

1. Idempotent Laws: `A∪A=A,  A∩A=A`
2. Identity Laws: `A∪ø=A,  A∪𝒰=𝒰,  A∩ø=ø,  A∩𝒰=A`
3. Complement Laws: `A∪AC=𝒰,  A∩AC=ø,  𝒰C=ø,  øC=𝒰`
4. Involution Law: `(AC)C=A`
5. Associative Laws: `(A∪B)∪C=A∪(B∪C),  (A∩B)∩C=A∩(B∩C)`
6. Commutative Laws: `A∪B=B∪A,  A∩B=B∩A
7. Distributive Laws: `A∪(B∩C)=(A∪B)∩(A∪C),   A∩(B∪C)=(A∩B)∪(A∩C)`
8. DeMorgan’s Laws: `(A∪B)C=AC∩BC,   (A∩B)C=AC∪BC`

Check out the next video for a bunch of example problems! :)
