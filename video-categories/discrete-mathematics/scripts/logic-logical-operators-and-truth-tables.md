	This video continues the conversation on composite propositions and logical operators. I will also be introducing the concept of truth tables. For convenience, I have defined two propositions: p≣“2+2=5” and q≣”Some mammals lay eggs.”
	
	I want to begin by explaining that a truth table is simply a table that displays the truth values of propositions. For example, p is either true or false and q is as well. However, when I include our first logical operator, you will see how the table grows. Keep in mind that if two propositions have the same truth table values, we call them logically equivalent (≣).

	The first logical operator I will introduce is the conjunction, which is denoted by ∧, and is pronounced “and”. p∧q is defined as such: If p and q are true, then p∧q is true; otherwise p∧q is false. Furthermore, p∧q is read as “the conjunction of p and q” or simply “p and q”. To analyze this in the truth table, you must realize that this conjunction has four possible cases. See the diagram for an explanation.

	Imagine that you are walking down a path. You come a split in the path and can only choose to go left or right. At the ends of both the paths, there is yet another split in which you choose right or left. Based on the diagram you can see that there are four destinations at the end of the original path. The same is true for truth tables. Our splits are true or false instead of left or right, and our destination are called cases. The concept of cases is INCREDIBLY important in both programming and mathematics! I cannot stress this enough!!! If you miss a case while executing a conditional statement, your program will not run properly.
	[The resulting truth table for the conjunction is seen above]

	The second logical operator is the disjunction, which is denoted by ∨, and is pronounced “or”. p∨q is defined as such: If p and q is false, then p∨q is false; otherwise p∨q is true. p∨q  is read as “the disjunction of p and q” or simply “p or q”. Just like the conjunction, we have four cases.

	Finally, the last and simplest logical operator, is the negation, which is denoted by ¬, and is pronounced “not”. ¬p is defined as such: If p is true, then ¬p is false; and if ¬p is false, then p is true. This truth table only has two cases since it is the negation of p, which also only has two cases.

Alternate notations for conjunctions: p&q, p&&q, p•q, pq
Alternate notations for disjunctions: p+q
Alternate notations for disjunctions: p’, ~p or p-bar
