This video continues the conversation on composite propositions and introduces logical operators. I will also be introducing the concept of truth tables. For convenience, I have defined two propositions: `p≣"2+2=5"` and `q≣"Some mammals lay eggs."``

I want to begin by explaining that a truth table is simply a table that displays the truth value of a proposition. For example, `p` is either true or false and `q` is either true or false. Keep in mind that if two propositions have the same truth values, we call them logically equivalent (`≣`).

[Begin explanation with truth table]
The first logical operator I will introduce is the conjunction, which is denoted by `∧`, and is pronounced "and". `p∧q` is defined as such: If `p` is true and `q` is true, then `p∧q` is true; otherwise `p∧q` is false. `p∧q` is read as "the conjunction of p and q" or simply "p and q".

The second logical operator is the disjunction, which is denoted by `∨`, and is pronounced "or". `p∨q` is defined as such: If `p` is false and `q` is false, then `p∨q` is false; otherwise `p∨q` is true. `p∨q` is read as "the disjunction of p and q" or simply "p or q".

[Begin exaplanation with tree]
Notice that these truth tables have four possible outcomes. This is due to the “MN-Rule” which we will cover in later videos. So for now, imagine that you are walking down a path. You come to a split in the path and must continue left or right. At the end of each path, there is another split in which you continue left or right. Based on the diagram you can see that there are four possible destinations. The same is true for truth tables. Left or right corresponds to true or false, and each destination corresponds to a case. The concept of cases is important! If you don’t account for a case when programming, your code may not run properly.

Finally, the last and simplest logical operator, is the negation, which is denoted by `¬`, and is pronounced "not". `¬p` is defined as such: If `p` is true, then `¬p` is false; and if `¬p` is false, then `p` is true.

Alternate notations for conjunctions: `p&q, p&&q, p•q, pq`
Alternate notations for disjunctions: `p+q`
Alternate notations for disjunctions: `p’, ~p or p-bar`

Join me in the next video for examples of these operators using the laws of the algebra of propositions.
