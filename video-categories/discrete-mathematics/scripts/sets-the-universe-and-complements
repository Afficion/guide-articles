This videos introduces the concept of the universal set and set complements. Similar to how the ø is a subset of every other set, the universal set (𝒰) is a super of every set in question! We can define this universal set, often called the “universe”, to be whatever we want. If 𝒰 is not explicitly defined, we will allow it to be the set of all real numbers (R).

For example, let us make some comments on N and Z. Remember, since we didn’t define 𝒰, it is currently equal to R. Observe that by definition, N⊂R and also Z⊂R. This make sense since all sets are within the universal set. For instance, if we had the set M = {1,2,x}, M⊈R, as it contains the element x. Since M contains the element x, it is only partially within the universe (R). _Show venn diagram_

The complement of a given set B, denoted as BC, is defined as BC = {r∈𝒰 : r∉B}. I hope this definition sounds familiar. The relative complement of two sets, in this case 𝒰 and B is the same definition as set difference from our video on set operators! :O Recall that A∖B = {r∈A : r∉B}, so for our case 𝒰∖B = {r∈𝒰 : r∉B} = BC. What happens if I try to take the set difference of ø and 𝒰? That is, what is øC and 𝒰C?

Let A = ø, then AC = 𝒰∖A = 𝒰∖ø = 𝒰.
Let A = 𝒰, then AC = 𝒰∖A = 𝒰∖𝒰 = ø.


_Note: Show other notations for complements_
