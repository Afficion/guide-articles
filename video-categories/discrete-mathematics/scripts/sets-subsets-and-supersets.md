The topics of this video will cover subsets, supersets, and the universal set. I have defined two sets F={6,2}, A={3.1415,1,6}, and will also be relying on your knowledge of N, Z, and R from previous videos.

"F is a subset of Z" is denoted and defined as `F⊆Z  = {∀x∈F: x∈Z}`
"F is a proper subset of Z" is denoted and defined as `F⊂Z  = {∀x∈F: x∈Z and ∃y∈Z, y∉F}`
"Z is a superset of F" is denoted and defined as `F⊇Z = {x∈Z: ∀x∈F}`
"Z is a proper superset of F" is denoted and defined as `F⊃Z = {∃y∈Z: y∉F but ∀x∈F, x∈Z}`

By these definitions, you should be able to see that in order to achieve equality, two sets must be subsets of each other!

Now that you have an understand of subsets. I want to explain what the universal set is. So far we have only compared two sets to each other. But what if I told you that all sets are a subset of the universal `set(𝒰)`? We can define this set to be whatever we want, however we will assume it is the set of all real number (R) unless otherwise stated.

For example, let us observe the sets A and F. Remember, since we didn’t define `𝒰`it is equal to `R`. Now, observe that `A⊂R` and `F⊂R`. This makes sense, because all sets are within the universal set. For instance, if we had the set `C = {1,2,x}, C⊈R`, as it contains the element x. Since it contains this element, it is only partially within the universe.

Why should you care about the universal set? It allows me to give a rigorous definition of what are known as complements. For example, consider the set `B={1,2}`. By definition, `BC={x: x∉B}`. Therefore, if `𝒰=R`, then `BC=R∖B=R∖{1,2}`. You will see that concept of complements can have profound impacts on the readability and functionality of your code.
