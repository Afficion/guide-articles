	This video will define subsets and supersets. I will be relying on your knowledge of N, Z, and R from previous videos.
Note: Use venn diagrams for explanation.


“N is a subset of Z” is denoted as N⊆Z.
	Definition: Every element of N is also an element of Z.
“N is a proper subset of Z” is denoted as N⊂Z.
	Definition: Every element of N is also an element of Z, but there is at least one 		element in Z that is not also an element of N.
“R is a superset of Z” is denoted as A⊇R.
	Definition: R contains all elements of Z.
“R is a proper superset of N” is denoted as N⊃R.
	Definition: R contains all elements of Z, but there is at least one element in R that 	is not within N.


	After I introduce the concept of implications in the logic section of this series, we will give more formal definitions to these sets. For now, understanding the general concept is all you need!
