In this video I will introduce interval notation, set-builder notation, and talk about some common sets.

The beauty of interval notation is that it allows us to efficiently describe the elements of a set. Suppose we wanted to say, “The variable x is between zero and one.” then we can simply write x∈(0,1) or 0<x<1. Similarly, if we wish to include the number one in the interval, we would write x∈(0,1] or 0<x≤1. If we wish to include zero and one, x∈[0,1] or 0≤x≤1.

A common and highly important set that can be defined using interval notation, is the set of real numbers, R = (-∞,∞). Note that in this instance we are not saying that R equals the point (-∞,∞). Although this is the same notation used for describing points on a Cartesian plane, this is a different context and shouldn’t be confused. We are simply saying that the set of real numbers contains all elements between negative infinity and infinity. Some other common sets are: null-set (ø), natural numbers (N), whole numbers (N_0), integers (Z).
